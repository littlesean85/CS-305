# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?.   
    Artemis Financial is a company looking to expand their business and needing to ensure they are up to date on security.  They brought us in because they want to be able to ensure they have security on lock because of the informaiton they handle on a day to day basis.  The secuirty was their top priority.  
    
# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
    Going through their vulnerabilities we were able to see what they did well and what needed work.  Through both the dependency checks and also through the supression feature.   These tests allowed us to look and see hat needed work and make sure that everything was secure.  It is important to handle things securly because when dealing with financials and SSNs you need to make sure it is hard to access that informaiton. 
    
# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
     the toughest part of this was getting the code to work properly for me and also reading the dependency checks.  This was because it was all new to me, so going through it was a bit overwhelming at first.  BUt I was able to take my time and work through them.  
     
# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
     We took it to the next level and added the SHA-256 to the coding to help wiht encryption for transactions.   I will continue to use the Maven dependency checks because they seem to be the most useful, and allows me to move forward with what techniques or ciphers to use if I am looking at secuirty.  
     
# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
     I checked on the code by running dependency checks and then also sending it rthrough certificates to make sure it was all secure.  I did the dependency check to ensure I hadn't messd with the code by adding the secrity features. 
     
# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
     I used the tutoring services and then some github posts, on different techniques for coding and security. 
     
# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
     I will show them any coding projects I have wrked on that I feel were successful.  I would also pair it up with something from when I first started out so they could see the growth taking place.
